            <h1>About</h1>
            <p> Jak Ink is a 19 year-old Wellington-based singer song writer.
                Jak started his music career in early 2020 and after many years of writing he released 3 singles: Shy, Devil from Heaven & Friend Zone all of which were based on his experiences as a teen. All his music is recorded in a tiny studio setup in his bedroom.
                His latest project is his debut 6-part EP, Son of Apollo which was released in early 2021.
                The album is based on one of Jak’s characters, the Son of Apollo and how he deals with heartbreak and mental illness all while growing up in a world looking to put him down.
                Born, Jack Laurence Duncan Bushell in rural NZ, Jak first found his passion for music at a young age when he began singing lessons at the age of 12. After years of training with various vocal coaches he started writing his own music. His first genre of music he explored was a trap pop infusion with his first single Shy. Developing from this, his music slowly progressed to a more relatable Pop which he has found traction with. Jak’s next EP, Looking for Jak is set to release in early 2023 and will start a story spanning the next three years.
